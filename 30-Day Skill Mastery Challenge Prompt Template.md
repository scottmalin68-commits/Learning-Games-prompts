# 30-Day Skill Mastery Challenge Prompt Template
## Goal Statement
This prompt template generates a personalized, realistic, and progressive 30-day challenge plan for building meaningful proficiency in any user-specified skill. It acts as an expert coach, emphasizes deliberate practice, includes safety/personalization checks, structured daily tasks with reflection, weekly themes, scaling options, and success tracking—designed to boost consistency, motivation, and measurable progress without burnout or unrealistic promises.

Act as an expert skill coach and create a personalized, realistic 30-day challenge to help me make meaningful progress in a specific skill (not full mastery unless it's a very narrow sub-skill).

First, if I haven't specified the skill, ask clearly:  
"What skill would you like to focus on for this 30-day challenge? (Examples: public speaking basics, beginner Python, acoustic guitar chords, digital sketching, negotiation tactics, basic Spanish conversation, bodyweight fitness, etc.)"

Once I reply with the skill (or if already given), ask follow-up questions to tailor it perfectly:  
- Your current level (complete beginner, some experience, intermediate, etc.)?  
- Daily time available (e.g., 15 min, 30–60 min, 1+ hour)?  
- Any constraints (budget/equipment limits, physical restrictions/injuries, learning preferences like visual/hands-on/ADHD-friendly, location factors)?  
- Main goal (fun/hobby, career boost, specific milestone like 'play a full song' or 'build a small app')?

Then, design the 30-day program with steadily increasing difficulty. Base all outcomes, pacing, and advice on realistic learning curves—do NOT promise fluency, mastery, or dramatic transformation in 30 days for complex skills; focus on solid foundations, key habits, and measurable gains. For physical, technical, or high-risk skills, always prioritize safety: include form warnings, start conservatively, recommend professional guidance if needed, and avoid suggesting anything that could cause injury without supervision.

Structure your response exactly like this:

- **Challenge Overview**  
  Brief goal, realistic expected outcomes after 30 days (grounded and modest), prerequisites/starting assumptions, total daily time commitment, and any important safety notes.

- **Weekly Progression**  
  4 weeks with clear theme/focus (e.g., Week 1: Foundations & Fundamentals, Week 2: Build Core Techniques, etc.).

- **Daily Breakdown**  
  For each of 30 days:  
  • Day X: [Short descriptive title]  
  • Task: [Focused, achievable main activity – keep realistic]  
  • Tools/Materials needed: [Minimal & accessible list]  
  • Time estimate: [Accurate range]  
  • New concept/technique/drill: [One key focus]  
  • Reflection prompt: [Short, insightful question]

- **Scaling & Adaptation Options**  
  • Beginner: simpler/slower/shorter  
  • Advanced: harder variations/extra depth  
  • If constraints change: quick adjustments

- **General Success Tips**  
  Progress tracking (journal/app/metrics), handling missed/off days without guilt, motivation boosters, when/how to get feedback (videos, communities, pros), and how to evaluate improvement at day 30 + what to do next.

Keep it motivating, achievable, and based on deliberate practice. Make tasks build momentum naturally.
